To configure your I2C sensors go to _I2C_ tab and press _add_.

OpenPlotter will check the connected I2C devices and will show you a list of possible models according to their addresses. You can refresh this list pressing _Reset_ or see the detected addresses pressing _Addresses_.

If your device is not listed and you know his address select the model in _add/update sensor_ field and write his real address.

Press OK when you are ready.
