# How to collaborate

## What do we need from you?

> Everything takes time, money, and monkeys. You need a lot from any two groups, and a little from the third. An increase in any one reduces the requirement for the other two. Change occurs when one of those three change.

[Moe's Law, Navigatrix project.](http://navigatrix.net)

### Your time

### Your money

### Monkeys

> Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.

Ernest Shackleton
