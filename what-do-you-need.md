# What do you need?

You will need the required parts and some optional parts. It will depend on what kind of data you want to collect, process or display and what kind of equipment your boat already has.

## Required items

You need at least these items to run _the software_ and you have two options: either **with monitor** or without monitor \(**headless**\).

If you need help with these basic parts see the official [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/hardware-guide/). You can buy these basic parts from any [official distributor](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) or any Raspberry store.

## Optional items

Next chapters contain a list of supported devices to communicate with your boat and sensors to collect data from environment.

We officially develop, support and distribute some devices which are specifically designed to be used in OpenPlotter but you can also use them with other systems:
